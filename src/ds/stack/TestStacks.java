/**
 * A stack is a collection of items. PANCAKES
 * LIFO - Last In First Out  ----PANCAKES! THINK OF HOW THEY GET PUT ON A PLATE AND ATE
 * 
Task 1: 
Implement the files as described in the last video with the following modifications:
Under ds package create sub-package stack 
In this package (stack) define the interface Stack, 
the class implementation FixedCapacityStack and the test class TestStacks.   
You must modify the javadoc and inline comments to express the functionality in your own words
In the class TestStacks, modify the method testPushItem() to add an empty line before any other message.
Modify TestStacks class to print at the beginning of the test the message (where you replace my name with your name):
Fixed Capacity Stack - Task 1 - by Mihai Boicu
Test and debug your program
EXECUTION PDF: increase the size of the output area (maximize), add two screenshots of the execution showing the 
beggining and the end of the output.
ANSWERS PDF: Provide an example where a fixed capacity stack must be used and one example where a fixed 
capacity bag must be used, explain why,  and explaining why the other structure will 
not be recommended in that situation. (paragraph answer) Task 2: Test pop method
In the class TestStacks, create a method testPopItem(), that will test the pop() method 
similar how testPushItem performs the test. Catch any error and print the error message. 
Print the operation, the poped item and the updated stack.
In the class TestStacks, update the method testStringStack(), 
to call four times the test pop item method after the elements were added.
Modify TestStacks class to print at the beginning of 
the test the message (where you replace my name with your name):
Fixed Capacity Stack - Task 2 - by Mihai Boicu
Test and debug your program
EXECUTION PDF: increase the size of the output area (maximize), 
add two screenshots of the execution showing the beggining and the end of the output.
